Upgrading
^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you upgrade your TYPO3 installation from 4.x to 6.2 / 7 / 8 you should upgrade this extension to v1.1.x. There shouldn't be breaking changes. But as always be careful and don't forget to backup all related stuff.

On the other hand, don't upgrade to 0.2.0 or 1.x.x, if your TYPO3 installation still is from the 4.5+ branches.
