Add page content "frsupersized"
===============================

- Go to Web -> Page

- Choose the page to add the new frsupersized plugin

- Add new content (where ever you want)

- Choose Tab Plugin => "Frsupersized"

- Inside the content element go to tab “Plugin”

- Insert images to the field "Image file(s) for full background,
  slideshow or banner". Maximum 30 images are possible.

- Optionally define the caption in "Slide Captions" (one caption per
  line)

- Optionally define the weblinks in "Link images to following URL" (one
  link per line)

- Configure the Supersized background settings in tab "Full Background"

- Optionally configure the Supersized slideshow settings in tab
  "Slideshow"

- Optionally configure the Supersized banner settings in tab "Banner"

- Which settings you can view and change depends from the rights the
  administrator of the website gives to you.

If a setting corresponds with a javascript option of the Supersized
jQuery plugin you will find the property of the javascript option at
the end of the label for this setting. E.g.:

Activating "Start Slideshow directly (autoplay)" (under tab
"slideshow") will set the javascript option "autoplay" to 1.

For a bit more detailed explanations of this settings look here:
http://buildinternet.com/project/supersized/docs.html

The settings are divided in four tabs: General, Full background,
Slideshow, Banner.

Under the general tab you can i.a.include images, optionally set the
slide captions and link url.

Under the full background tab you can configure the minimal dimensions
and the positioning of the slides related to the browser window.

Under the slideshow tab you can activate the slideshow and make all
slideshow related settings.

Under the banner tab you can activate the banner and set the
dimensions and the positioning of the banner.
