Banner Settings
===============

- If you don't activate the banner with the first setting, all other
  settings under this tab will be ignored.

- You can set width, height and the top and left position of the banner
  (in pixel).

- It is possible to activate the slideshow and the banner at the same
  time. You will have a slideshow in a banner format. Maybe you have to
  adapt the css style sheets in that case.

- The aspect ratio of the banner should be the same as the aspect ratio
  of the original image files.
