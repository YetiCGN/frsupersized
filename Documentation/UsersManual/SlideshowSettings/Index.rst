Slideshow settings
==================

- Most of this settings corresponds with a javascript option of the
  Supersized jQuery plugin.

- If you don't activate the slideshow with the first setting, all other
  settings under this tab will be ignored.

- If you activate “Individual thumb links for each slide (thumb\_links)”
  the thumb image files will be generated automatically. Standard size
  is 150px x 108px. Optionally you can change this dimensions. Be aware
  that maybe you have to change the css style sheets in that case. You
  are able to activate horizontal and vertical cropping of the
  thumbnails.

- You have to “Enable slide captions (slide\_captions)”, if you want to
  show the slide captions from tab “General”.

- You are able to activate the individual thumb links (thumb\_links),
  the slide counter (slide\_counter) and the slide captions
  (slide\_captions) without activating the control bar. Be aware that
  you have to adapt the css style sheets in that case..
